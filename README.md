#  Design a counter by using Arduino.

As you can see in the file, whenever we press the upper button, the counter will increase (it will increase by one number each time you press), but as we press the lower button, the counter will decrease (it will decrease by one number each time you press). When we press the middle button, the counter will be reset.

To build the circuit, I used:

- Arduino board.

- 7-Segment Display.

- Four NOT gates.

- Three buttons, to count up, down, and reset.
